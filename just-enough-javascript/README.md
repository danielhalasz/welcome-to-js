# Just Enough JavaScript

JavaScript is a huge and powerful programming language, this makes it exciting but also challenging to learn.

In this module you will only learn a small part of what JavaScript has to offer. You will learn _just enough_ JavaScript to make small programs that process text and interact with users. Why just enough, and not a little more? Because reading and understanding program logic is more important than JavaScript, so why let the code get in the way?

In this directory is is all the JavaScript you will find in this module's examples and exercises. Don't be mistaken, there's a lot you can do with only this!

## Priorities

Concepts and examples in this chapter are each given a priority (ü•ö, üê£, üê•). The main goal of this module is learning to read and trace code that is already written.

You know you have mastered an example when you can answer all the `[ask me]` questions about it, and/or when you can use a trace table to explain how it works.

## Exercises

There are a few different kinds of exercises in Just Enough JavaScript. None of these exercises will ask you to write code from an empty file, to write functions, or to pass tests.

Instead the exercises will be built around completed programs. You will need to either fill in missing pieces, rearranged the lines, or trace how the variables are used.

### Fill in the Blanks

Fill-in-the-blanks exercises will be JS scripts with some blanks for you to fill in and (sometimes) a comment describing what should happen. Some exercises will simple like this:

```js
console.log(true && _); // true
```

But others will be more complex. Larger exercises will open with the `?blanks` lens where you will be able to decide how many words you want to remove from the program. You will be shown a list of all the words that have ben removed from the program, and have the option to compare the modified program to the correct solution using a _diff editor_.

### Parsons Problems

Parsons problems are designed to help you study snippets of code without getting caught by errors. You'll be given lines of code and your task is to place them in order. But it's not always as easy as it sounds!
Exercises will have extra lines as distraction, you'll need to figure out which lines are part of the program and which are there to confuse you.

### Tracing Execution

You will learn how to _be the computer_, how to execute code line by line with your mind the same way the computer does. Until you learn how to _trace_ code, programs and bugs will be a mystery! After you've learned how to trace, it will still be hard to understand programs but you'll at least know how to start :) Learning to trace is tricky, but will save you many many hours in the future.

Because it can be hard to know if you are tracing correctly without someone by your side to answer your questions, there are a few buttons to help you along the way:

- **table**: the _table_ button will open an empty trace table in your browser that you can use to step through a program by hand.
- **trace**: the _trace_ button will log a trace of the program's execution to the console. You can use this to learn how to step through a program, and to see if your trace tables are correct.
- **openIn JsTutorLive**: exercises without user interactions can be opened in JS Tutor, this website will show you what is happening in program memory with each step.

If you like to draw on code as you trace what's happening you can do that with any file! Just replace `?--defaults` in your browser's URL bar with `?highlight` and you're good to go.

#### Trace Tables

Trace tables have been around as long as computer programming (probably). The challenge with a trace table is to run the code in your head, keeping track of all the variables in your program by hand. This is also called a _dry run_ or a _desk check_.

You can write trace tables on paper with a pencil, or you can use the trace tables built into Study Lenses. There are two different types of trace table available in Study Lenses:

1. **steps**: The _steps_ table asks you to be the computer and to go step by step through the program, recording each time a variable is declared, read, or assigned. When you use the steps table you can check your work by pressing `trace` button and comparing your table to the console output.
2. **values**: The _values_ table is the traditional type of trace table. With the _values_ table you only keep track of each time a variable is assigned a new value. You can also check your _values_ table by using the `trace` button but it will take a little more practice

You may find that the **steps** table is more helpful in the beginning when you are first learning. It forces you to pay close attention to each step of program execution.

Later on you may prefer the **values** table because it allows you to look at the bigger picture and see more clearly the _strategy_ (or _algorithm_) of a program.
